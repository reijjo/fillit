### Goals

* 'Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible.
Obviously, your main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time,
despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.'
* A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.

### Example:
